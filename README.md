# git-project-doctor

`git-project-doctor` is a local-first CLI for reviewing software repositories and generating update-planning reports. Phase 1 is read-only: it scans local files and safe Git metadata, then writes reports outside the scanned repo unless you explicitly point `--out` there.

## What It Generates

- Repo health report
- Dependency report
- README/documentation report
- TODO/FIXME report
- Git status report
- Security/secrets warning report with redacted values
- Recommended next steps
- Codex/Cline context file
- Codex/Cline task packets

## Install Locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Example Commands

```bash
project-doctor scan .
project-doctor scan ~/Documents/VSCodeProjects/Pirates_Babylon
project-doctor scan . --out ./reports
project-doctor git-status .
project-doctor todos .
project-doctor docs .
project-doctor codex-context .
project-doctor task-packets .
```

## Report Files

By default, `project-doctor scan PATH` writes:

```text
reports/
├── project_report.md
├── dependency_report.json
├── todo_report.json
├── git_status_report.json
├── repo_summary.json
├── repo_summary.md
├── codex_context.md
└── task_packets/
    └── 01-example-task.md
```

## Phase 1 Limitations

- No dependency freshness checks against the internet
- No package installation
- No Git write operations
- No repository modifications
- No AI API calls
- No database or scan history
- No web dashboard

## Task Packets

`project-doctor task-packets PATH` generates scoped Markdown prompts for Codex or Cline. Packets are based on scan findings, include task-specific rules, and are written under `reports/task_packets/`.

The generator remains read-only with respect to the scanned repository.

## Safety Model

The scanner ignores large or generated folders such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.venv`, `env`, `__pycache__`, `.cache`, `coverage`, and `reports`.

Possible secrets are detected by pattern only and values are redacted in output.

## Roadmap

Future phases require explicit approval before implementation:

- GitHub issue creation
- Dependency freshness checks
- Renovate config generator
- README auto-draft
- Dockerfile review
- GitHub Actions review
- Test runner detection
- AI-assisted repo summary
- React dashboard
- SQLite scan history
- Safe autofix mode
